### Q: I am new to Modern Testing and the podcast.  Where should I start?

### A: Alan and Brent have condensed their thoughts on Modern Testing into 7 principles you can find [here](http://https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/modern-testing-principles/)

Starting [here](https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/page/6/) the podcast goes into each principle in detail.  

Or:

Principle 1: Our priority is improving the business.

Principle 2: We accelerate the team, and use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.

Principle 3: We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and optimize in order to succeed, rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.

Principle 4: We care deeply about the quality culture of our team, and we coach, lead, and nurture the team towards a more mature quality culture.

[AB Testing – Episode 85: The Community Principle](https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-85-the-community-principle/)

Principle 5: We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product

Principle 6: We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between product hypotheses and business impact.

[AB Testing – Episode 87: The One About Data](https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-87-the-one-about-data/)

Principle 7: We expand testing abilities and knowhow across the team; understanding that this may reduce (or eliminate) the need for a dedicated testing specialist.
