# One of the Three Slack - Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The goal of this community is to provide a community of people who listen to, support, or want to discuss the AB Testing Podcast. We welcome all points of view and discussions, and strive to be a safe place for engagement.

We as members and admins pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, political affiliation, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community with our goal in mind. We pledge to remember this is a ​ professional setting ​and to act as we would in a work environment.

## Our Standards

Overeall, ask anything. Share your stories and ask questions about whatever is challenging you. This community is a great place to vet ideas or to get feedback on a variety of software development and testing challenges. We are powered by our members.

As Phillip Armour would say, it provides a place for all of us to discover what we don't know we don't know.

**Have a learning attitude** ​— if you see a conversation drifting into being polarizing, help guide the conversation. Ask questions before you get combative — and seek to understand before you make assumptions. Assume good faith and intention from your fellow community members. If someone else is not following this, use the :red_circle: emoji and alert an admin. Most of the topics in this Slack are newer to the software industry. As a result, misunderstandings will naturally arise and that’s ok, as long as there is a commitment to repair misunderstandings proactively and maturely as they arise.

**Trolling, attention-stealing behavior, or harassment of any kind is not tolerated** ​. If you are noticed trolling, you will receive one warning, if you are told again, you will be asked to exit the workspace for a short amount of time, possibly indefinitely. If an admin notices that a message is harmful to the community, they will either remove it or ask you to remove it. ​ _More details on this in below sections._

This workspace is governed by ​Chatham House rules​. This means no taking screenshots or posting content from OneOfTheThre outside of the Slack (unless you have a member’s permission). 

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Our current admins (which I believe are @angryweasel, @brent, and @perze) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community admins have the right and responsibility to remove messages and other contributions that are judged by the admins to not be aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (e.g. including our git repo - where this doc lives).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community admins responsible for enforcement at admin@learningfromincidents.io​, ​via a private DM, or a post in #lfi-admin-retro​. ​All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community admins are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Our admins will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### Correction

*Community Impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
*Consequence:* A private, written warning from community admins, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### Warning

*Community Impact:* A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
*Consequence:* A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### Temporary Ban

*Community Impact:* A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
*Consequence:* A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### Permanent Ban

*Community Impact:* Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
*Consequence:* A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.
